## **Explanation**
- Theres a file called file.py that does fizzbuzz to whatever number you want
- Theres another file called README.md (which is this file) that uses markdown (file extension .md)
- Knowing markdown isn't really important its just to make things easy to read
- In general, a README.md file is displayed when accessing the github/lab page for a repository
- Theres a folder called react_project its just how react works its random javascript frontend stuff
- Following the path react_project/src/ will lead you to where the code for a webpage is, web browsers interpret the html and css of the page (static display) and run javascript (which is actual code) that manipulates the displayed elements
- Backend for a webapp would be a webserver but to do that you 99% of the time use a framework (express in js, spring for java) so probably not enough time to make one (plus the idea would need a use case for client-server interaction)

# To actually run the webpage
- Go to the folder react_project in terminal and run `npm start`
- This will open up a page in your browser displaying what the page will look like and allowing the user to interact with the elements
- ~~To actually run react, i think you need to install npm and node first with `sudo apt-get install nodejs npm`~~ I googled maybe you don't but just test if it works with npm start
